## assignment4 write up  

In this assignment I just use the candy class instead of creating many concrete candies because I think itâ€™s not necessary to create so many candy classes since they only have name difference.

I use Neighborhood class to store the 4 household and store the candy object in each household. When traversing, I just visit each house and use askCandy method to compare the  dream list with the house_candy_list. And I store the collected candies in the array currentCandy. When I traverse all the 4 households I compare the dream list size and the collected candy size. If the size is the same then it means that the traversal is successful and I write the travesal file.
